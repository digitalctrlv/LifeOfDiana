                <p>[My first memory] is really the smell of the inside of my pram. It was plastic and the smell of the hood. Vivid memory. I was born at home not in hospital.</p>
                <p>The biggest disruption was when Mummy decided to leg it. That’s the vivid memory we  have - the four of us. We all have our own interpretations of what should have happened and what did happen. 
                    People took sides. Various people didn’t speak to each other. For my brother and I it was a very wishy-washy and painful experience.</p>
                <p>Charles [her brother] said to me the other day that he hadn’t realized how much the divorce had affected him until he got married and started having a life of his own.
                    But my other sisters - their growing up eas done out of my sight. I saw them at holidays. I don’t remember it being a big thing.</p>
                <p>I idolized my eldest sister and i used to do all her washing when she came back from school. I packed her suitcase, ran her bath, made her bed - the whole lot. 
                    I did it all and i thought it was wonderful. I always looked after my brother really. My sisters were very independent.</p>
